## Task 2: Customer Segment

The targeted demographic for the company are levied towards the high-end shoppers who reside in the United States. While not trying to discourage the middle and lower class from purchasing items, the products are of higher quality that have various costs associated with them. Since the business is centered about the curation model, it can assist most, if not all, needs and wants of customers. Should an individual wish to purchase a printer but doesn't know what model he or she wants, then our model could easily help determine what caters towards their personality the most.


## Task 3: Value Proposition

At Alinder, we have acknowledged the common problem of receiving low-quality products from various online marketplaces and we have made it our goal to guide customers to higher-quality goods. Along with this, we promise to provide faster delivery times and outstanding customer service as the satisfaction of our customers is extremely important to us. We want our consumers to be happy with the items they order from us and with the time it takes for them to arrive. If any part of the process seems unsatisfactory, we have a friendly and knowledgable customer support team ready to help. We also offer a full money back guarantee for items returned within 30 days.

Alinder is here to enhance everyone's online shopping experience!

#### 5 Year Plan

* Clothing will be added in the future, with our experts recommending what's hot, and having generalized recommendations based on pre-determined "looks".
* International expansion will begin in the near future, with Canada being a natural starting point for growth.
* If a particular product line proves to be less popular, it may be discontinued. The goal is to be a higher quality, more focused version of Amazon, we don't have to carry everything.
