## Task 3: Key Resources

Some of the vital resources we will need include manufacturers and warehouses. We will need manufacturers to get our products from since we do not make our own items, we organize the products in a way to make them readily available to our customers. Warehouses will also be necessary for storage of the products until they are ordered and ready to be shipped out.Location of our warehouses will be located on both coasts with one the midwest to allow connection between coasts. To provide a strong connection between the warehouses so that they may be fully stocked, is the use of transportation whether that is by air or on the ground. As for our human resources, we will need a management team to order more products to maintain our supply and to make sure daily process are fully and smoothly completed. Warehouse management will also provide assessments, organizations, and management of products and delivery of products. Warehouse personnel to operate machinery and to help transport items into the warehouses as they arrive, maintain inventory, and to prepare shipments to the customers.Ground transportation (partners/own) to allow quick transportation of products from warehouse to warehouse to allow delivery of products. Aerial transportation (partnership) allow quick transportation of products from one location to another.
