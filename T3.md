## Task 1: Team Leader
Michelle Julsen

## Task 2: Key Activities

Our key activities include maintaining a supply of products for our customers to shop for on our website. Because our platform is a curator model, enhancing our customers' shopping experience is one of our top priorities. The platform for our customers includes a website and app where shopping can be done and that both have customer support pages.


## Task 3: Key Resources

Some of the vital resources we will need include manufacturers and warehouses. We will need manufacturers to get our products from since we do not make our own items, we organize the products in a way to make them readily available to our customers. Warehouses will also be necessary for storage of the products until they are ordered and ready to be shipped out. Our warehouses will be located on both coasts with one in the Midwest to allow connection between coasts. To provide a strong connection between the warehouses, we will use ground and air transportation so that they may stay fully stocked. As for our human resources, we will need a management team to order more products to maintain our supply and to make sure daily process are fully and smoothly completed. Warehouse management will also organize and manage products and deliveries as well as provide assessments of these processes. Warehouse personnel will be needed to operate machinery and to help transport items into the warehouses as they arrive, maintain inventory, and to prepare shipments to the customers. Ground transportation (partners or our own) will be necessary for the transportation of products from warehouse to warehouse and to allow the delivery of products. Aerial transportation (partnership) will allow quick transportation of products from one location to another. There will also be a  human resources team that observe and supervise the workplace enviornment to ensure ethical work practices are being promoted ad followed.
