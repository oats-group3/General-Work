## Task 2: Key Activities

Our key activities include maintaining a supply of products for our customers to shop for on our website.
Since our platform is a curator model, helping customers is one of our top priorities. 
The platform we will develop includes a website that has a customer support page with listed apps that they could contact. 


## Task 3: Key Resources

Some of the vital resources we will need include manufacturers and warehouses. We will need manufacturers to get our products from since we do not make our own items, we organize the products in a way to make them readily available to our customers. Warehouses will also be necessary for storage of the products until they are ordered and ready to be shipped out. As for our human resources, we will need a management team to order more products to maintain our supply and to make sure daily process are fully and smoothly completed. We will also need workers to help transport items into the warehouses as they arrive, maintain inventory, and to prepare shipments to the customers.
