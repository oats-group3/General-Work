## Task 1: Team Leader
Michelle Julsen

## Task 2: Key Activities

Our key activities include maintaining a supply of products for our customers to shop for on our website. Because our platform is a curator model, enhancing our customers' shopping experience is one of our top priorities. The platform for our customers includes a website and app where shopping can be done and that both have customer support pages.


## Task 3: Key Resources

Some of the vital resources we will need include manufacturers and warehouses. We will need manufacturers to get our products from since we do not make our own items, we organize the products in a way to make them readily available to our customers. Warehouses will also be necessary for storage of the products until they are ordered and ready to be shipped out. Our warehouses will be located on both coasts with one in the Midwest to allow connection between coasts. To provide a strong connection between the warehouses, we will use ground and air transportation so that they may stay fully stocked. As for our human resources, we will need a management team to order more products to maintain our supply and to make sure daily process are fully and smoothly completed. Warehouse management will also organize and manage products and deliveries as well as provide assessments of these processes. Warehouse personnel will be needed to operate machinery and to help transport items into the warehouses as they arrive, maintain inventory, and to prepare shipments to the customers. Ground transportation (partners or our own) will be necessary for the transportation of products from warehouse to warehouse and to allow the delivery of products. Aerial transportation (partnership) will allow quick transportation of products from one location to another. There will also be a  human resources team that observe and supervise the workplace enviornment to ensure ethical work practices are being promoted ad followed. Intellectual Property is one of, if not the most, important assets a corporation has. The Alinder brand, as well as the logo, and any other piece of branding has been trademarked in the United States as well as most other countries that allow registration of brand marks. In addition, the Alinder Book logo has been copy written in the United States and other territories in order to protect our brand. Any and all legal ramifications required by law as well as company policy will be used to protect our brand from competitors as well as other nerdowells who wish to do harm or take advantage of our branding. Financials are an important component of any corporation, and we are no different. Financial matters such as Payroll, Taxes, and Bookkeeping, will be outsourced to an outside accounting and payroll firm in order to keep our corporation lean, at least in the beginning. Financial matters handled internally will be kept to a minimum in order to reduce financial staff needs.


## Task 4: Information Technology Platform

To run a website capable of handling large amounts of traffic, and safe enough to process sales, we would need a full on datacenter. To stay lean, at first this data center would be outsourced to a cloud provider such as Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud for Business. On our end, we would have some redundancy servers to keep us minimally active in case our dataserver goes down, and also to handle business happening at our offices. Any processing being done at our warehouses would be done in building using in-house data centers. These data centers would be solely responsible for product inventory management, and not website matters. The inventory management system would be large and robust, with barcodes on each product getting scanned at each movement in order to keep track of items and reduce loss. Each team member would be equipped with handheld scanner / inventory checkers, something like Zebra offers here: https://www.zebra.com/us/en/products/mobile-computers/handheld.html . These would enable our team members to work to their best abilities. When it comes to office matters, we would invest in either Office 365, Google Drive for Business, or another similar service that gives us all of the software we need to keep our business going in one neat little bundle. This software would allow our office based team members to communicate quickly, work together, and work solo very easily.
