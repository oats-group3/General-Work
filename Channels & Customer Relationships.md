## Task 1

# Customer Awareness

  Based on our generally upperscale customer base, we will be launching a thoughtout and sophiticated feeling advertising campaign. These will include advertisements in newspapers, magazines, and TV shows frequented by the upper-middle and upper classes we are generally targeting as well as heavier efforts in buisness districts in large, metropolitan areas. These advertisements will show off our curated style, while leaving the explaination just vague enough to make the customer curious enough to come visit our online marketplace to find out what it is all about. Another possible method is via word of mouth, possibly through a referal code system that nets both the suggestor and suggestie a reward with purchase.

# Customer Evaluations

  Our customer service representatives are always happy to hear our customers questions and concerns, we also welcome our customers to send in reviews of products that will then get factored in during the curation process. We will have a pretty genorous return policy to encourage return customers as happy customers are return customers. 

# Customer Purchasing

  Based on how our whole model is ecommerce, we will have a very easy to use system. The checkout process will attempt to be as fast and easy as possible, and will mobile friendly, with acceptance of native Apple Pay and Samsung Pay right off the bat. This will encourage impulse purchases, and will help the customer get back to their day as fast as possible. It really is as simple as placing items in a cart and then checking out as usual, or doing a one click checkout type deal that will allow the customer to press a button and be done.

# How we Deliver Value

  Alinder strives everyday to be the best shopping experience possible for our loyal customers. Our loyalty program helps show our gratitude towards our customers by rewarding them for shopping with us. Our bulk shopping approach also keeps prices down, as we will get a bulk discount, which will in turn be passed down to our customers. Hassle free returns will make the customer happy, even when they were disappointed with their shopping experience. The biggest point we have over our competition is our curation process. We will make sure your product is genuine, made to last, worth the cost, and is overall a great product to ensure our customers don't get Amazoned into a subpar product.
  
  # Customer Support
  
    Customer Support is avliable 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We are availale through online chat, email, or via phones. Our customer service team will strive to keep wait times non-exist by having well staffed centers, well trained staff, and making sure the customer is happy the first time around. Our customer service teams will be well trained, but organized. We will not expect our general customer service team to do tech support, or any other specialized task, the welcome menu when you call will have one option, which is what department. This helps to make sure the customer gets the right team member the first time.
