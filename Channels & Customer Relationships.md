## T2: Task 1


# Customer Awareness

<p>Based on our generally upper-scale customer base, we will be launching a thought-out and sophisticated advertising campaign. These will include advertisements on television, in magazines, and applications frequented by the upper-middle and upper classes. We are generally targeting business districts in large, metropolitan areas and we have been putting forth heavier efforts in these areas. These advertisements will show off our curated style while leaving the explanation just vague enough to make the customer curious enough to venture to our online marketplace to find out what it’s all about. Another possible method is via word of mouth, possibly through a referral code system that nets both the referrer and referee with a reward
 for their purchase.</p>

# Customer Evaluations

<p>Our customer service representatives are always happy to hear our customers’ questions and concerns. We also welcome our customers to post reviews of products that they have purchased as it will assist the curation process. We will have a pretty generous return policy to keep customers satisfied because happy customers are return customers.</p>


# Purchases

<p>Because our whole model is e-commerce, we will have a very user-friendly system. The checkout process will be as fast and easy as possible and it will be mobile friendly with the immediate acceptance of native Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. This will encourage impulse purchases and will help the customer get back to their day as fast as possible. We keep it as simple as placing items in a cart and then checking out as usual or doing a one-click checkout that will allow the customer to press a button and be done.</p>


# How we Deliver Value

<p>Alinder strives to create the best shopping experience possible for our loyal customers. Our loyalty program helps show our gratitude towards our customers by rewarding them for shopping with us. Our bulk shopping approach also keeps prices down, as we will get bulk discounts, which will then be passed down to our customers. Hassle-free returns will make our customers happy, even if they were disappointed with their shopping experience. Our greatest selling point that we have over our competition is our curation process. We will make sure your product is genuine, made to last, worth the cost, and is of good quality overall to ensure our customers don't get Amazoned into a subpar product.</p>


# Customer Support

<p>Customer Support is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We are available through online chat, email, or via phones. Our customer service team will strive to keep wait times minimal by having well-staffed centers, well-trained staff, and by making sure the customer is happy the first chance we get. Our customer service is highly organized and we will not expect our general customer service team to do tech support or any other specialized task. There will be a welcome menu when calling that will ask the caller to input the number for the corresponding department. This helps to ensure that the customer speaks with the right team member the first time.</p>


## Task 2


# Relationships With Customers
  
<p>Our model is supported by maintaining friendly relationships with our customers. We also keep a record of emails sent and prioritize those that need the most immediate attention so we can answer questions and resolve any issues there may be. As stated above, our customer support will operate in the most effective way by bridging any distance gaps to ensure that the customer speaks with the most appropriate person. There will also be community forums available for discussions and to encourage direct communication with users who have had similar questions and experiences. We will always strive to provide the most satisfactory communication to all of our customers.</p>
