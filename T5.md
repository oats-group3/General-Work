## Task 4: Revenue Streams

#### Projected Profits

As Alider gains momentum, we will be expecting to make an average yearly profit of approximately $18 million for the first 3 years of operation. We are also expecting our user base to grow by at least 50% each year as well which will of course lead to greater sales revenue. Currently, we will be making nearly all of our profit from our sales on retail products. A small fraction of our profit will also come from ads from other businesses that we choose to sponsor on our site.

Retail Products: 97%

Ad Revenue: 3%<br/><br/>

In the near future, we also plan on allowing third-party retailers on our site as long as we believe that their products meet our strict quality standards. From each sale made by these retailers, Alinder will take 15%. Once we begin supporting this, we will expect to be making about 30% of our profit from the third-party retailer sales, but our own product sales will still account for a majority of our profit while ad revenue will remain around 3%.

Future Third-Party Retailers: 31%

Retail Products: 66%

Ad Revenue: 3%
